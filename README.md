## About
This repository contains low-quality [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) command completion scripts. All was generated semi-automatically.

## Notice
Many CLI programs provide better completion scripts than what's available here. Better check your commands first.

## Limitation

* Multi-level subcommand is NOT supported yet, and the scripts here may behave erroneous.


## List of fish scripts

Please refer to [the list](https://github.com/yamaton/h2o-curated-data/blob/main/general.txt), but officially-supported commands are excluded here.


## Adding more compleation files

I generated fish scripts in this repository using [my program](https://github.com/yamaton/h2o) extracting information from help/man pages. Please [post](https://github.com/yamaton/h2o-curated-data/issues/1) to request for further additions.
